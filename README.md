# Newspaper Webpage Project

This is a simple newspaper webpage project for Intro to Web Development course.

**[Try it here](http://sirdaniel711.github.io/newspaper-project/)**

## To-Do List:
- Add links to the nav items, and a hover pseudoclass for these items
- Maybe replace `<div`> tags with `<section>, `<article>, `<ul>, and/or `<nav>
- Use the pseudoclass :nth-child(n) to target each specific nav item for coloring them (currently, an extra class is assigned to each nav item to color them)
- Use flex: 1 to have the nav items expand to fill in the space evenly (currently, padding is used to space them out)
- Add some text spacing for the paragraphs to make them a little easier to read
